# Predicting-Closing-Price-of-Vanguard-Tech-ETF-with-ML-models

In order to run our model you will have to download the CSV file called VGT.csv that includes the stock data from January 2004 - March 2020. Once that file is downloaded you will only have to download the Notebook called Predicting the closing Price of Vanguard Tech ETF and run it to find the closing price for the next day. 

In this repository there is also a Exploratory Analysis Notebook that includes more information on the dataset and has different insights into the data in the dataset.
